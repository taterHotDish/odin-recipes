    <h1>Easy Alfredo Sauce</h1>
    <!-- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Cucurbita_moschata_Butternut_2012_G2.jpg" alt="Cook Icon" width="200"/> -->
    <p>
        While technically not an alfredo sauce, 
        this sauce comes together quickly and is subjectively easier
        to make than a traditional alfredo sauce.
        This sauce can be made ahead of time, stored, and is readily reheated when needed.
    </p>
    <p> 
        This sauce is better emulsified than traditional alfredo 
        because it uses a bechamel sauce (white sauce) as the base.
        Since the sauce is so well emulsified, 
        it will not separate when reheated like traditional 
        alfredo sauce which relies on cream for the sauce base.
